      description: >
        A pubkey represents an SSH public portion of a key pair with name and body.
        Pubkeys must have unique name and body (SSH public key fingerprint) per each account.
        Pubkey type is detected during create operation as well as fingerprints.
        Currently two types are supported: RSA and ssh-ed25519. Also, two fingerprint
        types are calculated: standard SHA fingerprint and legacy MD5 fingerprint available
        under fingerprint_legacy field. Fingerprints are used to check uniqueness of key.

        If a pubkey was uploaded to one or more clouds, the deletion request will
        attempt to delete those SSH keys from all clouds. This means in order to delete
        a pubkey the account must have valid credentials to all cloud accounts the pubkey
        was uploaded to, otherwise the delete operation will fail and the pubkey will
        not be deleted from Provisioning database.
        This operation returns no body.

        When pubkey is created, it is stored in the Provisioning database. Pubkeys are
        uploaded to clouds when an instance is launched. Some fields (e.g. type or
        fingerprint) are read only.
